This is a basic web application that you can use for finding the weather at a particular place,whatever the city may be.

I have used the basic programming concepts to develop this project
For  the front end i Have used Html,CSS,javascript
back end is mainly the api(openweathermap.org)
by using the api key i was able to get the real time data from the corrsponding websites server


In order to run the code you can use any IDE as you Like for me I am using VScode
open up the folder and just run the html and you would be good with my project
